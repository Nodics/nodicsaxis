# Nodics Axis

Nodics Axis is the reusable Back Office frontend for a single Nodics-based
customer project deployment.

Canonical user and contributor documentation is authored as granular pages
under `source/documentation` and deterministically generated into the committed
CMS import release under `data/core`. The retired legacy `docs/` files remain
accounted for in the migration register after coverage, detail-preservation,
generated-pack, and rendered-content gates approved their replacement.

Axis is a client-side web application. It authenticates human users through
Profile, retrieves an authorized bootstrap contract from Back Office, and then
calls the authoritative APIs of discovered Nodics modules directly.

## Boundaries

- Nodics remains the backend and API authority.
- Axis contains presentation and interaction behavior, not authoritative
  business logic.
- Every customer project has an isolated Axis deployment.
- Axis does not depend on whether Nodics runs as a monoServer or distributed
  module servers.
- CMS descriptors can select Axis-owned components but cannot deliver
  executable frontend code.

See
[Axis Architecture and Ownership](architecture-and-ownership.md) for the
per-customer deployment model, repository responsibilities, contract authority,
security boundary, and verification expectations.

See [Frontend Technology Stack](frontend-technology-stack.md) for the
approved tools, state ownership, styling decision, repository shape, and
dependency-governance rules.

Use the [Feature Delivery Checklist](feature-delivery-checklist.md) for
repository-boundary analysis, security, contract testing, accessibility,
documentation placement, and completion evidence for every Axis slice.

Read the
[Axis Implementation And Documentation Contract](implementation-and-documentation-contract.md)
for partial-discovery rules, repository placement, required use cases, and the
acceptance contract followed by human developers and AI tools.

See [CMS Delivery and Renderer Integration](cms-delivery-and-renderers.md)
for the resolved-page client, trusted renderer boundary, validation rules,
cache isolation, and login integration.

See [Documentation Content In Axis](documentation-content.md) for dynamic
Framework, Swaggers, Nodics Axis, and future project documentation sources;
per-product CMS catalogs; the import-ready Axis content pack; renderer
ownership; security boundaries; and failure behavior.

See [Module Health](module-health.md) for backend-driven operational
navigation, the typed registry client, module and node readiness presentation,
security boundaries, responsive behavior, and extension rules.

See [Imports and Exports](imports-and-exports.md) for immutable init, core,
and sample release discovery, validation, installation, history, security, and
the intentionally disabled export surface.

See [Employee Login, Recovery, Screen Lock, and Dashboard](employee-login.md)
for startup discovery, employee-only authentication, persistent BackOffice
policy consumption, protected routing, logout, and failure recovery.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 24
- npm 10 or 11
- A local Nodics backend when integration behavior is required

## Start locally

Start Nodics in a separate terminal:

```bash
cd ../nodics
npm start -- ENV=startioLocal SERVER=monoServer
```

Install and start Axis:

```bash
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Axis runs at <http://localhost:3100>.

## Environment and runtime configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the local/build values there.
The repository includes a safe local `.env`; Git ignores it so each developer
or deployment can use different values.

```dotenv
AXIS_BACKOFFICE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
AXIS_ENTERPRISE_CODE=default
AXIS_CLIENT_CONTRACT_VERSION=1
AXIS_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=10000
AXIS_BROWSER_SESSION_CSRF_COOKIE_NAME=nodics_axis_csrf
AXIS_ASSISTANT_MAXIMUM_EVENT_BYTES=65536
AXIS_ASSISTANT_RECONNECT_WINDOW_MS=120000
AXIS_ASSISTANT_IDLE_TIMEOUT_MS=45000
AXIS_DEV_HOST=0.0.0.0
AXIS_DEV_PORT=3100
AXIS_STRICT_PORT=true
AXIS_BUILD_SOURCEMAP=true
```

Vite validates these values and generates `/axis-config.json`:

```json
{
  "backofficeBaseUrl": "http://localhost:3000",
  "enterpriseCode": "default",
  "clientContractVersion": 1,
  "requestTimeoutMs": 10000,
  "browserSessionCsrfCookieName": "nodics_axis_csrf",
  "assistantMaximumEventBytes": 65536,
  "assistantReconnectWindowMs": 120000,
  "assistantIdleTimeoutMs": 45000
}
```

Axis loads that document and then obtains the active Profile and CMS endpoints
from BackOffice's low-disclosure public bootstrap. Axis does not maintain a
second module endpoint list.
Invalid or unavailable configuration produces a recovery screen instead of
attempting authentication.

`.env` and `axis-config.json` are public configuration, not secret stores.
Never place passwords, tokens, API keys, private keys, or credentials in them.
Only explicitly named `AXIS_*` variables are consumed; Axis does not expose
arbitrary environment variables to browser code.

For production, the generated `dist/axis-config.json` may be replaced during
deployment so endpoints can change without rebuilding Axis. Serve it with
`Cache-Control: no-store`. Serve hashed assets with long-lived immutable
caching.

## Quality commands

```bash
npm run format:check
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run test
npm run build
npm run verify
```

The implemented Gold and Charcoal foundations, responsive shell, recovery
states, accessibility behavior, and extension rules are documented in
[Axis Design System And Static Shell](design-system-and-shell.md).

The implemented authenticated Assistant CMS route, renderer hierarchy,
direct-module connection validation, and typed HTTP client are documented in
[Axis Assistant Frontend](assistant-frontend.md).

The implemented Schema Workbench discovery, schema browser, bounded record
list, relationship editor, record detail, Create, Update, and governed Delete
are documented in
[Axis Schema Workbench](schema-workbench.md).

## Current scope

The current foundation proves the frontend runtime boundary, safe startup, CMS
delivery/renderers, employee authentication, secured BackOffice bootstrap,
CMS-driven login/recovery/lock pages, idle screen locking, protected dashboard
routing, logout, the CMS-driven Assistant workspace shell, typed Assistant HTTP
contracts, authenticated resumable SSE transport, isolated Assistant
presentation state, and the CMS-driven Schema Workbench browser with
direct-module schema discovery, bounded record reads, and independent Address
and Contact creation, relationship coordination, record detail, generated
Update, and governed Delete. The Operations workspace includes Module Health
with permission-filtered navigation, module summaries, on-demand registered
node details, and governed refresh. Visual designers remain future slices.

## Customize and extend safely

Use Axis as the reusable frontend base and place customer-specific pages,
renderers, typed clients, theme composition, and CMS presentation data in the
customer Axis project. Keep customer business services, schemas, workflows,
permissions, and API implementations in its Nodics backend project.

The smallest extension adds one focused feature directory, one backend-driven
navigation or renderer contract, and mirrored tests. Do not modify reusable
framework behavior for customer needs, hardcode backend-owned labels, create a
parallel module registry, or move authorization into the browser. Prove
startup, permission, contract-version, malformed-data, failure recovery,
responsive and WebView, integration, regression, and production-build
behavior. Rollback removes the customer registration and deployment artifact
without mutating Nodics-owned persisted contracts.
